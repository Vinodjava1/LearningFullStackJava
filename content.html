    <h4>Chiken Biriyani</h4>
    <figcaption>Biryani is a mixed rice dish that was thought to have originated from Iran before settling in 
        modern India. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish) and spices.
         To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables for the meat.</figcaption>
